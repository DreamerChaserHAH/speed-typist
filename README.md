# Speed Typist

A typist speed application built using C++

## DevLog
### Day 1
I have been mingling with conan and vcpkg for days, and settled down with vcpkg (easier to setup), but even then, there were weird errors in vs code. I cannot build for x64 it seems, even though I have x86. I have no idea why that's the case however.

But since, it is compiled with x86_64 compiler, it seems to work okay
